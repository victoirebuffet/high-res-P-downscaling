# High resolution downscaling of precipitation with deep learning (from Rampal et al., 2022)

This is my computing project for the 2nd year of my master's degree at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. Thanks to Neelesh Rampal & NIWA for the informations on his work.


The training data can be downloaded at https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/ETmb7B8rpHrcKsM.

The models and their trained weights can be downloaded at https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/gy9HtXtjjWZeRPt.

Just put the two downloaded folders in the main path, and the main.ipynb file should run smoothly.
